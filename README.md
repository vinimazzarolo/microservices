An implementation of communication between two services written in Go: one is a producer and the other is a consumer. The communication is asynchronous, using Kafka. Both the producer and consumer are monitored by Grafana, which collects data from Prometheus. The producer is being exposed by Caddy, which is handling reverse proxy. Also, it is possible to manage Kafka using an UI service.
